## Project Description

This project aims to test Python libraries for WiFi sensing technologies. The first prototype utilizes the NTU-FI HumanID dataset, which is responsible for identifying individuals in three distinct scenarios. So far, the code reads .mat files (generated by MATLAB) and generates heatmaps of the received amplitudes. Each file corresponds to the three cases, containing 114 subcarriers (rows) and 2000 samples (features) collected. Finally, there is a function that constructs a video showcasing the generated heatmaps for Type 2 from the training folder of the dataset.

## Project Status

The project is currently under development. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.

## Features and Application Demonstration

- Reads .mat files generated by MATLAB.
- Generates heatmaps from received amplitude data.
- Handles three different identification cases.
- Constructs a video from heatmaps for Type 2 scenarios.
